## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the bot token is correct
- Check that the bot is added to the group
- Verify the bot has admin permissions

### Commands don't work

## ⚠️ Important Notes for Render Deployment

- **Free Tier Limitations:** Render's free tier sleeps after 15 minutes of inactivity
- **Data Storage:** Bot data is stored in memory only. Restart = data loss
- **Database:** For persistent storage, add MongoDB/PostgreSQL later
- **Webhook Mode:** Bot runs in webhook mode on Render (not polling)
- **Domain Setup:** Replace `your-app-name.onrender.com` with your actual Render domain
